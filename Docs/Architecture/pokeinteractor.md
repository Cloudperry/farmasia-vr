# Usage of PokeInteractor

The PokeInteractor used in the project is part of the Unity Engine's own [XR Interaction Toolkit](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.interaction.toolkit@2.3/manual/index.html). It is used, as the name suggests, for interaction and through interactions to track and fire events that might be a part of the tasks of the game.
