# How to cast the screen from the Quest to a browser
This document details how to connect to the eduroam network on the Quest and how to use that to cast your screen to a browser.

## Connecting to the eduroam network
1. Download the [geteduroam apk package](https://apkpure.com/geteduroam/app.eduroam.geteduroam) to your computer.
2. Install the apk to your Quest using SideQuest or MQDH.
3. Open the app on the quest and log in using your University of Helsinki credentials.
    - Note that the certificate authentication method may not always work. When logging in using the username and password method, your username is `username@helsinki.fi`, where the username is your AD username, so for example `rkeskiva@helsinki.fi`
    - More detailed instructions can be found [here](https://helpdesk.it.helsinki.fi/en/instructions/logging-and-connections/eduroam-android-devices)

2. Select Cast.
