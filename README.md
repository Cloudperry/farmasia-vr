# Pharmacy VR Game - Will you manage to prepare eye medicine correctly?

(Software engineering project, University of Helsinki 2019)

## Description

Pharmacy VR Game is a virtual way of practising the process of preparing clean eye medicine. Taking place in the cleanroom laboratory environment, the game works as an introduction to medicing making and cleanliness testing. The game consists of two parts â€“ preparing the medicine and testing the microbiological cleanliness of the product. The process is divided into different steps affecting the success in the game and the cleanliness of the product. The choices made by the player will be scored according to their correctness and order.

This project was developped as part of the course Software engineering project, organized autumn 2019 at the University of Helsinki. Pharmacy VR Game was built in collaboration with the Faculty of Pharmacy (University of Helsinki) as well as the animation and visualization students of Metropolia, University of Applied Sciences.
