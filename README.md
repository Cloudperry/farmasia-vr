# Pharmacy VR Game - Will you manage to prepare eye medicine correctly?

(Software engineering project, University of Helsinki 2019)

## Description

Pharmacy VR Game is a virtual way of practicing the process of preparing clean eye medicine. Taking place in a cleanroom laboratory environment, the game works as an introduction to medicine production and cleanliness testing. The game consists of two parts â€“ preparing the medicine and testing the microbiological cleanliness of the product. The process is divided into different steps that affect the success in the game and the cleanliness of the product. The choices made by the player will be evaluated and scored.

This project was developed as part of the course Software engineering project, organized during the autumn of 2019 at the University of Helsinki. Pharmacy VR Game was built in collaboration with the Faculty of Pharmacy (University of Helsinki) as well as the animation and visualization students of Metropolia, University of Applied Sciences. All rights are reserved to the University of Helsinki.

Customer: Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki

Implementation environment: Online Course / VR, Faculty of Pharmacy
