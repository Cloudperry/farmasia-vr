(Software engineering project, University of Helsinki 2019)


Pharmacy VR Game is a virtual way of practising the process of preparing clean eye medicine. Taking place in the cleanroom laboratory environment, the game works as an introduction to medicing making and cleanliness testing.

The process is divided into different steps affecting the success in the game and the cleanliness of the product. The choices made by the player will be scored according to their correctness and order.
